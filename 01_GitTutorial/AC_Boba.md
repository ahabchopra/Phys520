# Introduction to Git
 
Takehome message: **Use git**

## Assignment
Clone https://github.com/beards-lab/Phys520

- Create a initials_your-nick-name.md into the 01_GitTutorial folder
  - E.g. FJ_jez.md
- Write down what you 
  1. like about GitHub
  I really like that you can edit files without losing any past changes. Committing and reverting makes it really easy to go back to previous versions.
  
  2. dislike about GitHub
  I think that as files grow bigger and there are more changes, it would get really complex to navigate branches and file versions. I'm worried about how that will work with other collaborators as well.
  
  3. At least one question
  Can anyone clone my respository? How do I set permissions on who can access code I push to Github?
  
- Commit, push, and issue a pull request
